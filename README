These two scripts sort and convert your lossless music.

mover.rb asks where your flac files are and where you want the sorted library to be,
and then copies over and renames the files based on tag into a subdirectory called
"Songs". It then creates and Albums and an Artists directory, and subdirectories for all
the various artists and albums in your collection, and then fills the appropriate sub-
directories with hard links to the appropriate songs.

converter.rb does the same, except it also transcodes the songs with LAME first. You can
specify what command line options you wish to pass to LAME.

Requirements: A Linux-based operating system, Ruby 1.8.7, lame, metaflac, and a collection
of flac files

P.S. This code is currently kind of crappy, and a lot of my personal preferences are
hard-coded.
